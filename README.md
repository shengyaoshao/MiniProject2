## Introduction
The topic for this project is the autonomous wheelchair. Wheelchairs give many people with disabilities the freedom to move around. But for those with both leg and arm disabilities, using the wheelchair on their own is extremely challenging. Creating an autonomous wheelchair using the ROS platform might be the solution to this problem.\
ROS is short for Robot Operating System. But unlike what the name suggests, ROS is not an operating system in the conventional sense; it is an open-source platform for users to design, implement, and test their robot projects. Being an open-source platform, it has a ton of existing resources users can use to help build their projects.  ROS also provides users with tools and libraries for obtaining, creating, writing, and running codes across multiple computers.

## Analysis of the ROS-based Autonomous Navigation Wheelchair
The ROS-based Autonomous Navigation Wheelchair consists of hardware and software. For the hardwares, they chose the Bora wheelchair model which was electric powered and had an embedded system that can communicate with other systems. they also used the GPSB board to control the wheelchair's directions and speed. An Omnidirectional Camera was mounted on top of the wheelchair to provide vision data for the system to configure the surroundings, distance as well as obstacles in almost 360 degrees. Multiple sensors were placed on the wheelchair to detect the surroundings as a supplement to the Omni directional camera.\
For their software part, they used the PIBG which consisted of two phases. The first phase was to create a path images database, the raw data was first acquired by the camera and then applied vision-based localization algorithm to the raw data to produce the data for the database. The second phase was
