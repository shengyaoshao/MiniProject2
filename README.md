## Introduction
ROS is short for Robot Operating System. But unlike what the name suggests, ROS is not an operating system in the conventional sense, it is in fact a open-source platform for users to design, implement and test their robot projects. ROS also provides users with tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing and running codes across multiple computers.
