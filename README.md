# Mini project2
## Introduction
The topic for this project is the autonomous wheelchair. Wheelchairs give many people with disabilities the freedom to move around. But for those with both leg and arm disabilities, using the wheelchair on their own is extremely challenging. Creating an autonomous wheelchair with the ROS plaform might be the solution to this problem.\n
ROS is short for Robot Operating System. But unlike what the name suggests, ROS is not an operating system in the conventional sense; it is an open-source platform for users to design, implement, and test their robot projects. Being an open-source platform, it has a ton of existing resources users can use to help build their projects.  ROS also provides users with tools and libraries for obtaining, creating, writing, and running codes across multiple computers.
